Algorithm :  steps to perform any operation (Step by step solution of any problem)

suppose i need to search any element from the array.
  so i have to follow some steps to solve this steps 

  fiststep   :   define array
  second step :   define the element which want to search
  third step   :   traverse throgh the defined array
  fourth :          match elemement by every array elemement
  fifth  :         if elemement match then return the reseult
  sixth:           if element not match then what should be the reseult
  eight :          return result

Algorithm depends on two factor
1: time complexity 
2: space complexity

Time complexity   :   time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the 
execution

Space complexity   :   space complexity is he amount of space requird to solve a problem
space complexity = auxillary space + input size

Big O (O'h) notation :   use to denote the complexity (both)
